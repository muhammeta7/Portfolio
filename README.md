# :briefcase: Portfolio  
Week 2 assignment was making the professional portfolio responsive using HTML/CSS and media queries. Site includes links to different pages such as about me, portfolio, and  contact. Sadly I did not accomplish that due to my inexperience. The second part of the assignment was to make the same portfolio using a Bootstrap template.
